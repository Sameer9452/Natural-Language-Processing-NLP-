### Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create an effective spam detection system. The notebook includes:
- Data loading and exploration
- Text preprocessing and feature extraction
- Model training and evaluation
- Analysis of results

### Installation
To run this project locally, ensure you have the following software installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sameer9452/spam-ham-detection.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd spam-ham-detection
```

Install the required packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook NLP.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to run each cell sequentially. This will guide you through the entire spam detection process.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains labeled messages as either spam or ham. 

### Model
The project uses  machine learning models:
- Naive Bayes

 model is trained on the preprocessed data
